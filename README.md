UnPlayer is a fully automatic Rainmeter player.
This is not just any normal player. This works straight out of the box. No setup required.

---

UnPlayer supports all players from NowPlaying's supported list, WebNowPlaying, Spotify, and Google Play Music Desktop Player.

**If you are using a browser:**
For browser support, (Youtube, Web Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) you need to download the companion extension in your browser.
For Chrome, go [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webnowplaying-companion/jfakgfcdgpghbbefmdfjkbdlibjgnbli), and for Firefox, go [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webnowplaying-companion). Other browsers, if they support Chrome/Firefox extensions, should work too.

To use the browser extension in Firefox, you'll need to go to the **about:config** page and set **network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS** to true.

**If you are using Spotify:**
If you want to use Spotify with UnPlayer, you need to use khanhas's [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Guide-for-Rainmeter-user).
