UnPlayer supports all players from NowPlaying's supported list, WebNowPlaying, Spotify, and Google Play Music Desktop Player.<br>

For browser support, (Youtube, Web Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) you need to download the companion extension in your browser.<br>

To use the browser extension in Firefox, you'll need to go to the about:config page and set network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS to true.<br>
